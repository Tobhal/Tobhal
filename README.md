### About me
Master's student studying Applied Computer Science at Ã˜stfold University College (HIOF) and specializing in Machine Learning and Cyber-physical Systems.

### Master thesis
Currently writing my master's thesis on "fine-tuning [ALIGN](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/align) for handwriting recognition".
The code is available here: [https://github.com/Tobhal/HIOF-Align-fine-tuning](https://github.com/Tobhal/HIOF-Align-fine-tuning)

### Bachelor thesis
The code for the bachelor thesis I wrote at HIOF is available in this repo: [https://github.com/Tobhal/Tremolometer](https://github.com/Tobhal/Tremolometer)
